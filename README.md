# Penano

Penano is a virtual piano controlled by your hands.
Using MediaPipe hand tracking, YOLO object detection, and a real-time audio engine, it lets you play piano notes by moving your fingers in front of a camera.
You can also record your playing, save it as MP3, and generate music using Suno AIâ€™s API based off the notes you played.

Penano won the "Best Musical Hack" award at HackMIT, sponsored by Suno AI.
